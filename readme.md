## Overview

SecureConnect is a comprehensive security monitoring system that integrates computer vision and deep learning to provide intelligent surveillance capabilities. The system processes video feeds in real-time, detects objects and unusual activities, and provides secure remote access to monitoring features.

## Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Utilizes YOLO models to identify people, vehicles, and other objects of interest
- **Virtual Camera Integration**: Creates virtual camera feeds that can be used by other applications
- **API-Driven Architecture**: RESTful API for programmatic control and integration
- **Customizable Alerts**: Configure notifications for specific detection scenarios
- **Multi-source Support**: Connect to IP cameras, webcams, or video files
- **Secure Remote Access**: Monitor your security feeds from anywhere
- **Low Resource Consumption**: Optimized for performance on standard hardware

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SecureConnect.git
cd SecureConnect

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Create a configuration file named `config.yaml` in the root directory:

```yaml
cameras:
  - name: Main Entrance
    source: 0  # For webcam, or rtsp://user:pass@ip:port/path for IP cameras
    enabled: true
  - name: Back Door
    source: "rtsp://192.168.1.100:554/stream"
    enabled: false

detection:
  model: yolov8n.pt
  confidence: 0.5
  classes: [0, 2, 5]  # person, car, bus

alerts:
  enabled: true
  webhook_url: "https://your-webhook-url"
```
