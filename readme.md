SecureConnect
Overview
SecureConnect is a comprehensive security monitoring system that integrates computer vision and deep learning to provide intelligent surveillance capabilities. The system processes video feeds in real-time, detects objects and unusual activities, and provides secure remote access to monitoring features.

Features
Real-time Object Detection: Utilizes YOLO models to identify people, vehicles, and other objects of interest
Virtual Camera Integration: Creates virtual camera feeds that can be used by other applications
API-Driven Architecture: RESTful API for programmatic control and integration
Customizable Alerts: Configure notifications for specific detection scenarios
Multi-source Support: Connect to IP cameras, webcams, or video files
Secure Remote Access: Monitor your security feeds from anywhere
Low Resource Consumption: Optimized for performance on standard hardware
